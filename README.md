hi I need some new web developer network engineer tutors / friends
 someone I can trust to help me understand what my ex is putting
 us through I know basics when it comes to cyber security and network 
and code I am trying to learn more as we speak but I'm looking mostly 
for someone who can explain to me what a lot of these codes
 mean or how I could decrypt them I am also looking to figure out 
how to get my own certification in my own policy so I can have more control
 over our browser and router thank you I hope this works out for the best- 👋 Hi, I’m @Minnorskillkido
